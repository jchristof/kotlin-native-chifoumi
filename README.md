# Test the project

## Circuit

This circuit schema represents what I use in my project:

## Install C libraries on your Pi

This part explains how to install different dependencies on your raspberry pi in order to test the project.

### Pre-requiste

Since we are using the Tensorflow 2.0, we will need glibc-2.28 which is only available starting from Debian 10 (Buster). So make sure your rasbian is upgraded, otherwise the tensorflow part will not be able to work.

Then make sure you have `cmake` installed on your raspberry pi:

```
$ sudo apt-get install cmake
```

### lib pigpio

Connect to your pi with SSH:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/joan2937/pigpio
$ cd pigpio
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

### libPCA9685

https://github.com/edlins/libPCA9685

```
$ git clone https://github.com/edlins/libPCA9685
$ cd libPCA9685 && mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ ctest
$ sudo make install
```

### Tensorflow

A japanese engineer has compiled the Tensorflow C libraries for raspberry pi and put it on github to share:
https://github.com/PINTO0309/Tensorflow-bin

A huge arigato!! 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/PINTO0309/Tensorflow-bin
$ cd Tensorflow-bin/C-library/2.0.0-armhf
$ ./install-buster.sh
```

Note: in order to use Tensorflow 2.0.0 you will need Raspbian/Debian Buster which is bundled with glibc 2.28.

/!\ **For cross-compilation on a Linux machine or a MacOS, you have to download these libraries to your machine for linking during the compilation. In my code you can see they are gitignored because github does not allow file larger than 100MB.** /!\

## Generate the executable

Compile the project:

```
$ ./gradlew build
```

After a successful build you should be able to see that the binaries are generated under the `build/bin/chifumi` folder. In order to test the binary, deploy it on your Pi via SSH, make sure you update the SSH configuration, source folder and destination folder in `build.gradle` with your own configurations:

```
$ ./gradlew deployOnPi
```

> Note: you have to configure the [passwordless SSH access](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/passwordless.md) on your Pi to make the SSH plugin work.

If it's the first time you deploy on your Pi, you need to make sure your `.kexe` file is executable, then execute the binary with `sudo` to test with your circuit:

```
$ chmod 777 chifumi-robot.kexe
$ sudo ./chifumi-robot.kexe
```

## Other ideas

- Support `linuxArm64`?
- Desktop or other remote control

## Troubleshooting

### Error when deploying with SSH plugin

If you ran into this problem:

```
* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':deployOnPi'.
> com.jcraft.jsch.JSchException: invalid privatekey: [B@57eea633

```

That is caused by the private key headers generated by different versions of OpenSSH. You can refer to [this Stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53134212/invalid-privatekey-when-using-jsch) to solve the problem.
